This project is a down-and-dirty attempt at creating a simple framework for
approaching an interview question from Jean-Marc. It includes simulations to
model the behavior of robots and allows visualizing their movements.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.11 installed, along with the necessary libraries.
You can install the required packages by running:

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

### Running the Simulations

If you'd like a visual representation of the simulations running, you can use
the provided watcher scripts:
- Linux: watcher-linux.sh
- Mac: watcher-mac.sh

Execute the appropriate watcher script in a terminal to view the simulation in
real time.

To run the simulation on a Linux or Mac, execute the following command:

``` python simulate.py ```

To run the simulation on a Windows machine, please first [follow the
instructions provided here](https://system76.com/).
